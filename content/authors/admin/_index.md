Elroy is a privileged man born and bred in Singapore. Even after completing his Bachelor's in Computer Science at a reputable university, his programming skills remain at a low level. Jumping out of his Web Development job, he searched high and low for motivation before settling on learning Cloud Technology. With his limited experience in AWS, he forced himself to learn the world of Cloud by taking on the famous AWS Solutions Architect Associate certificate. By sheer determination and hard work, he attained certifications in AWS CCP and AWS SAA in a span of 2 months. 

Then came a surprise invitation from AWS to interview for an Associate Solutions Architect role, which was the dream position he had set his sights for. Fresh off the certifications grind, his Cloud and AWS knowledge helped him to breeze through the technical interview. However, his subpar performance during the Loop interview with the manager cost him greatly. Although he picked up the pieces and finished strongly in the subsequent rounds, a part of him knew that it would not be enough.

O﻿n the other hand, he had been interviewing with Google for a Cloud Traineeship program. He was offered a spot for this 1-year long program and would be placed with a Customer Engineering team who provides technical guidance for customers in the pre-sales phase. His team manager has assigned him the task of deep diving into using NoSQL in GCP and how it can benefit customers. Here he is now, creating a blog to journal his learnings, experiences, and reflections on his year-long journey.
